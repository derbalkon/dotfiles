> Just a backup of my dumb and boring dotfiles using [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm).

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Proxy, proxy, proxy. Stay cool and stay [clashy](https://install.appcenter.ms/users/clashx/apps/clashx-pro/distribution_groups/public).

### One-liner

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derbalkon/dotfiles/master/.config/yadm/setup.sh)"
```

This will

- install Xcode Command Line Tools
- pour Homebrew
- install yadm, fetch and sync dotfiles
- bootstrap to do some preference customs by yadm
- install other brew (casks/mas) packages

## To-do

Too much, can't relate.
