> Just a backup of my dumb and boring dotfiles using [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm).

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Proxy, proxy, proxy. Stay cool and stay [clashy](https://install.appcenter.ms/users/clashx/apps/clashx-pro/distribution_groups/public).

### One-liner

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derbalkon/dotfiles/master/.config/yadm/presetup.sh | sh -
```

This will

- install Xcode Command Line Tools
- pouring Homebrew
- install environment packages including yadm
- fetch and sync dotfiles by yadm
- bootstrap to do some preference customs by yadm

## To-do

Too much, can't relate.
